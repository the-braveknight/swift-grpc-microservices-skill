# Modular-monolith extraction runbook

Use this runbook for one bounded context and repeat it for an entire monolith. Work in vertical slices; do not attempt a mechanical target-per-layer rewrite of the whole system.

## 1. Establish the baseline

1. Read repository instructions and inspect `git status` in every involved repository.
2. Build the relevant packages before editing. Record pre-existing failures rather than fixing unrelated code.
3. Inventory `Package.swift`, products, targets, direct dependency edges, executables, command trees, configuration extensions, deployment manifests, and CI/build commands.
4. Trace each selected feature from inbound controller/handler through use-case protocol and implementation to repositories, statements, migrations, tables, and background jobs.
5. Search by entity, repository, table, schema, use-case protocol, configuration key, and operational file.

Produce a boundary inventory:

| Item | New service | Consumer/monolith | Temporary bridge |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Business behavior | Core use cases | Caller-facing protocols only | gRPC-backed implementations |
| Data | Dedicated service database | No direct access after cutover | Explicit data migration |
| Contract | Versioned proto | Released proto dependency | Compatible `v1` rollout |
| Runtime | gRPC server and migrations | Long-lived gRPC client | Internal DNS |

## 2. Choose extraction order

Draw the feature dependency graph. Extract leaf capabilities with clear ownership first. For every incoming or outgoing dependency, classify it as:

- local domain behavior that moves with the slice;
- synchronous query/command requiring an RPC;
- asynchronous business fact that may later require messaging;
- accidental shared persistence that must be severed;
- shared utility that can remain a small package dependency.

Do not extract two contexts into one service solely because their tables currently join. Decide the owning service and replace the join with an explicit contract or a locally maintained projection based on actual consistency requirements.

## 3. Define and release the contract

1. Add `<Service>Protos` to the shared `<project>-protos` package.
2. Put files under `Sources/<Service>Protos/<organization>/<service>/v1/`.
3. Define messages around service capabilities, not database tables. Use RPC names matching business operations.
4. Include only fields consumers need. Model stable identifiers explicitly; omit owned identifiers from create requests.
5. Generate public clients, servers, and messages.
6. Build the proto package, review generated symbol names, commit, tag, and publish a semantic version.

Prefer additive evolution. Reserve removed fields and names. Do not modify a released message incompatibly.

## 4. Build the producer package

1. Run `swift package init --type executable` in the new repository.
2. Reshape targets to `<Service>Core`, `<Service>Postgres`, `<Service>GRPC`, and `<Service>`.
3. Copy the selected entities, repository ports/errors/commands, use-case contracts, and behavior into feature-first Core folders. Preserve behavior and naming, including the `useCase(input:)` call form; do not introduce new value objects or clock abstractions during extraction.
4. Remove monolith framework imports from Core. Remove every manifest dependency the extracted slice does not import.
5. Reintroduce the Core `Database` protocol and use-case context protocols.
6. Copy and adapt Postgres repositories, statements, and migrations. Remove the old schema qualifier because the new service owns the database. Let the database stamp creation dates and generate identifiers. Make `CreateServiceRole` the first migration.
7. Add gRPC services and colocated `+Protobuf` conversions, with per-RPC identity checks.
8. Add the `serve` composition root, with boot migrations behind `--migrate-database`.
9. Add the service's environment pieces per [environment.md](environment.md).
10. Build the entire producer.

When copying as-is conflicts with a settled convention, make only the boundary-required adjustment: convert `public` to `package`, change a schema-qualified table to an unqualified table, replace an old shared monolith database wrapper with the Core `Database` protocol. A monolith module that exposes `public` API to other modules keeps it until the consumer is adapted.

Do not delete the monolith's table or migration during the copy phase. Complete producer and consumer verification, decide how existing data moves, execute the cutover, and only then remove old persistence.

## 5. Adapt the monolith consumer

1. Add the released proto dependency.
2. Add direct gRPC/protobuf products only to targets that import them.
3. Keep the existing API-facing `XUseCaseProtocol`, input, error, and entity so callers do not absorb transport types.
4. Replace the concrete local use-case implementation with one that wraps the generated gRPC client.
5. Map local input to requests, responses to local entities, and RPC status to local use-case errors.
6. Construct the shared `GRPCClient` in the executable composition root from scoped required host/port configuration, with the stack's mTLS client factory.
7. Inject it into the consumer use cases and include it in `ServiceGroup`.

Do not leave the old Postgres database/context variable in composition once no local use case for the extracted feature consumes it. Remove obsolete imports and manifest dependencies from the affected target.

## 6. Wire deployment

1. Add the service's own Postgres instance and its owner and service-role credentials to `.env.example`.
2. Give the service `command: ["serve", "--migrate-database"]`, gated on its instance's health check.
3. Add `<service>`, gated on successful migration and available only on the internal network.
4. Add the service to the certificate script's process list, merge `*tls`, mount its own subdirectory of the certificate volume read-only, and gate it on `tls-init`.
5. Add consumer `GRPC_<SERVICE>_HOST` and `_PORT` using the producer's name on the internal network, and a consumer `depends_on` for startup ordering.
6. Render and validate with `docker compose config` and verify image names and commands.

On a managed container platform or any other ingress, expose only the public HTTP edge. gRPC service-to-service traffic stays private and mutually authenticated; the certificate volume is created by the same Compose file, so a platform that runs it needs no host-side step.

## 7. Move data and cut over

Treat data migration as a separate explicit plan:

1. Measure existing rows and constraints.
2. Choose downtime copy, dual-write, change-data capture, or backfill plus short cutover based on availability requirements.
3. Define idempotent import behavior and reconciliation checks.
4. Back up before destructive operations.
5. Deploy the producer and verify health/migrations.
6. Move and reconcile data.
7. Deploy the consumer using gRPC.
8. Observe errors, latency, and row counts.
9. Keep rollback viable until confidence criteria pass.

Never infer permission to drop old tables or discard data. If the user has not chosen the migration strategy, finish the non-destructive extraction and surface the decision.

## 8. Retire the old slice

After cutover verification:

- Remove old Postgres repositories, statements, contexts, migrations, and schema creation for the extracted context.
- Remove obsolete database construction from the monolith composition root.
- Remove unused package dependencies and imports.
- Search for old table/schema names and repository types across source, scripts, and deployment.
- Confirm no other context directly reads the extracted database.

## 9. Verification matrix

Run the smallest checks early and full checks at gates:

| Repository | Required checks |
| --- | --- |
| Proto package | `swift build`; inspect target/product and versioned path |
| Producer | `swift build`, migration registration, executable help/command tree |
| Consumer | full build; search for direct persistence references |
| Deployment | `docker compose config`, database health gate, migration completion gate, internal DNS/env alignment, certificate mount |

Also inspect the final diff and dirty state in every repository. Do not claim failures caused by pre-existing changes were introduced by the extraction.

## 10. Whole-monolith progression

Maintain an extraction ledger for all contexts:

```text
candidate → contract designed → producer ready → consumer adapted → deployed → data cut over → local slice retired
```

Complete one context through retirement before multiplying partial extractions, unless a shared contract release or deployment change makes parallel preparation clearly safer. Reassess dependency direction after every extraction because removing one context changes the remaining monolith's seams.
